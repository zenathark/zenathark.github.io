      <description>I’m member of a community that enjoys the art and animation that comes from japan. In other words, I’m an Otaku. I knew the term Otaku when I was in high school, after I was already into this culture of giant robots and mythical heroes for years. Where honor and dreams are the goal and the struggle to achieve them the journey. In other words, stories filled with heroes in a journey.</description>

      <description>How does your outward appearance (i.e. cloting, makeup, hairstyle, accessories, etc.) reflect your cultural identity? My cultural identity is expressed by my choice of comfort cloths and practical hair style. My day usually revolves around academia, fitness and creativity. It can be seen as a lazy style. However, my choice of not having a car, training every day and be as active as I can as a teacher makes some type of clothes uncomfortable and impractical.</description>

      <description>As a teacher, a question that I often hear from my students is &amp;ldquo;How can I learn X?&amp;rdquo;. One of the best ways to ensure that you will learn is to find out which mechanisms are reqired for learning.
Good teachers often design its courses taking into account different needs that students may have for achieve retention and understanding for the relevant topics. However, is of particular interest for anyone to understand how we learn and what its needed for adquiring knowledge in order to go beyond the course requeriments or to learn skills of particular interest outside of academia.</description>
