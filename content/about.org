Welcome to my personal web site.

On this site you will find content about my research on Digital Signal
Processing, Image Processing and Video Processing.

Also, I like to write about Programming Languages, mainly focused on its design
and advantages on different implementations. Some Programming Languages I like
are Julia, Rust, Scala, Lisp and its variants, Haskell, etc.  With the use of
different languages come its tools. I will also be writing about programming
tools and how them impact the development. Currently I use a customized [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]]
editor. My dotfile configuration can be downloaded from my [[https://github.com/zenathark/dotfiles/][github repository]].
You can also find content about Game Design specifically on programming
techniques for different game mechanics and engines.

The content of this site is written for Computer Sciences undergrad and
postgraduate students, and the general academic community. Also, game design
enthusiast can find something of interest.

Finally, on this site I also include a list of my [[/publications/][publications]] and links to my
different social media accounts.
