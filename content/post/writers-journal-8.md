How does your outward appearance (i.e. cloting, makeup, hairstyle, accessories, etc.) reflect your cultural identity?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My cultural identity is expressed by my choice of comfort cloths and practical hair style. My day usually revolves around academia, fitness and creativity. It can be seen as a lazy style. However, my choice of not having a car, training every day and be as active as I can as a teacher makes some type of clothes uncomfortable and impractical.

How do your behaviors and practices (i.e. rituals, daily activities, routines, habits, ect.) reflect your cultural identity?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My morning routine constist mostly of cooking my meals for all day, as I spent almost I day in college. This is because my choice of eating healthy as much as possible. Also, all days I practice programming because I have the responsability with my students and my career to be always up to date.

How your beliefs and values (i.e. opinions, commitments, memberships, principles, etc.) reflect your cultural identity?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of my values come from my choice of an intellectual life. As growing up I read books and watch cartoons that favored introspection and a high sense of honor and repect for life. Also, my beliefs come from the same readings and the need to repect others' ideas.

How do your dietary and domestic practices (i.e. hygienic routines, meals and mealtimes, food choices, daily chores) reflect your cultural identity?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My diet reflects a concern for the well being of my body. Also, it supports my daily routine of physical and mental excersise. My domestic practices show an interest for a clean and healthy environment as I usually have a schedule for cleaning and sorting out my desk.

How does your region or location in the world reflect your cultural identity?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a hard question. I have never felt a particular identification to the city I live. However, I can say that my region is rich in food culture, mainly Baroque, which is the kind of food I like to cook and eat.

Describe a time when you were judged, excluded, or misuderstood because of one of the cultural traits noted above.

One of the things that comes up constantly is my choice of doing a PhD. Most people around me is into the culture of making money as fast as possible. A choice of an academic life is usually bizarre to them.
