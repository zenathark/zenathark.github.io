      <description>Learning Process As a teacher, a question that I often hear from my students is &amp;ldquo;How can I learn X?&amp;rdquo;. One of the best ways to ensure that you will learn is to find out which mechanisms are reqired for learning.
Good teachers often design its courses taking into account different needs that students may have for achieve retention and understanding for the relevant topics. However, is of particular interest for anyone to understand how we learn and what its needed for adquiring knowledge in order to go beyond the course requeriments or to learn skills of particular interest outside of academia.</description>

      <description>Outcomes Reflection The Arizona State University offers a course through edx.org called ENG101 English Composition.
I decided to take this course in order to improve my writing skills overall. As researcher, most of my work is published on technical journals that require an specific structure that for us who english is our second language is easy to follow. However, I have found that while is easy to just blindly follow the classic technical writing style, in order to write high quality papers I have to be aware of how I do my writing.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal web site.
On this site you will find content about my research on Digital Signal Processing, Image Processing and Video Processing.
Also, I like to write about Programming Languages, mainly focused on its design and advantages on different implementations. Some Programming Languages I like are Julia, Rust, Scala, Lisp and its variants, Haskell, etc. With the use of different languages come its tools. I will also be writing about programming tools and how them impact the development.</description>
