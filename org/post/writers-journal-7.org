Some people feel generating ideas as an elusive task. Something that only great
minds can do. However, most of the time we can generate ideas.

Generating ideas is a skill, and as such, it must be practiced. The first main
problem is that western cultures lately are focused on the outside. How we look,
how we sound, etc. This makes us worry not to said or do anything that may seem
silly to others. Another problem is a cultural feeling of hastiness. Nowadays we
are used to want everything as fast as possible. Fast food, quick easy money, you
can name it. Ideas take time do develop, we can only create an environment that
facilitate us to create ideas, but we can't hurry the process.

People that are able to conjure ideas know how to deal with the sense of
failure.  Not all ideas that we will come up with are going to be good but in
order to have a good idea we need to have a thousand of bad ones. Dealing with
failure and others' opinions is an important part of the process. Also, creative
people are familiar with his or her own mental process. Most people I know that
is creative have some rituals. Some brainstorm with his peers or talk about his
project with her friends and family. Others are quiet thinkers that take their
time alone before coming up with a new ideas. Some people require a clean and
organized environment, others require eclectic environments. The key is to find
what works and what kills creativity for you. Another important element for
generating ideas is to be exposed to the ideas of others. Books, music, theater,
everything that comes from others ideas can nurture creativity. Though, it also
requires to find what kind of stimulus is the ideal.

Everyone can be creative, but not everyone will be brave enough to be creative.
