      <description>Learning Process As a teacher, a question that I often hear from my students is &amp;ldquo;How can I learn X?&amp;rdquo;. One of the best ways to ensure that you will learn is to find out which mechanisms are reqired for learning.
Good teachers often design its courses taking into account different needs that students may have for achieve retention and understanding for the relevant topics. However, is of particular interest for anyone to understand how we learn and what its needed for adquiring knowledge in order to go beyond the course requeriments or to learn skills of particular interest outside of academia.</description>

As researcher, most of my work is published on technical journals that require an specific structure that for us who english is our second language is easy to follow. However, I have found that while is easy to just blindly follow the classic technical writing style, in order to write high quality papers I have to be aware of how I do my writing.</description>
