<h1 id="how-japan-s-cultural-values-are-being-adopted-by-young-mexicans">How Japan&rsquo;s cultural values are being adopted by young Mexicans.</h1>

<p>Since a few years ago, the youth in Mexico is going through what I see as a crisis of cultural identity. No longer with hold the old values of family and honor. It is past the time when people trusted each other. Teenagers in turn are in the search for values that resonate with them. Some of them have found such ideas in foreign cultures, in particular Asian cultures like the Chinese, South Korean and Japan cultures. This crisis is a result of a set of problems accumulated from past generations. Teenagers that have begun to assimilate other cultures like the Japanese culture is struggling for acceptance in a society that cannot find their own identity.</p>

<p>Mexico&rsquo;s population is very young. In 2010, an More and more people from the ran study revealed a population&rsquo;s age average of 26 years old (INEGI, [1]) with 27% of the total population younger than 15 years old. Nowadays, one of the most common discussions among teachers is the lack of values in teenagers. Drugs or alcohol consumption, laziness and lack of commitment are the most usual complains. However, such behavior is more of a symptom of a bigger issue that started the previous generation, an issue about the steady erosion of our cultural identity.</p>

<p>People born between the 1910s and the 1960s lived in a post revolutionary country. Full of stories like Rio Frio&rsquo;s bandits or Las Adelitas.</p>

<p><img src="/images/wp1/adelita.jpg" alt="A photograp of an Adelita." /></p>

<p>A country with a steady economy growth and strong sense of nationalism. The economy&rsquo;s growth reached its peak in the late 1960s. In the 80s, Television and VCRs became more and more common for the middle class. Shows from other countries, mainly from the U.S., started challenging our values. People look for better education in U.S. and Europe, bringing with them new ways in life. However, at the same time, what before was praised as cultural identity in the post revolutionary era began to be seen as <em>antiquated</em> and people that still kept them as <em>uneducated</em>.</p>

<p>This cultural shift had a big impact on the children born between the 70s and the 90s. By that time, extended families kept close contact. It was pretty common for children to live with their grandparents. Living between two generations with different values, kids at that time had hard time figuring out what was to be Mexican. Mexican government implemented programs to highlight Mexican values, but they looked so old for us. Everything from music to family values. Families start to fall apart. Divorce&rsquo;s rate began to steadily rise, leaving children with two messages: previous values are <em>old</em>, new values makes you <em>suffer</em>. It was a hostile environment with messages of failed marriages, confusing values and foreign messages. Nowadays, children from that decades have children of their own. In a time where children are more than ever exposed to ideas from around the world, parents have hard time guiding their sons and daughters to adopt good and functional values. In a country full of political and social struggle, kids find themselves in a void of distant old stories about a great raising nation, uncertain values and attractive ideas from other countries.</p>

<p>In this search of identity, urban tribes were born. Counter-cultural groups big and small, mostly formed of teenagers have adopted ideas from different places and in some cases from different decades. Punks, Darks, Skaters, and more are a common sight in public places around big cities and even in some small communities. A particular group that has been target of mocking for it own contemporaries are the young ones attracted to the Japanese culture. Since the late 70s, public television had runs of Japanese animation. Mainly targeted to young audience, runs of Great Fortress Macross or Ironman 28 could be found at after school ours. As time went by, Japanese animation or anime by its popular name became more and more popular. What was once known merely as cartoons and were classified together with any type of animation became a thing by its own. Anime became a common word in the day to day language. Japanese language schools began to appear.</p>

<p>Members of this group show signs of cultural assimilation. They have began to adopt stuff like food and music as well as anime. A few years ago I had the opportunity to met a group of japanese inmigrants that worked at my state&rsquo;s public college. One of their usual meeting places was a small dinner close to the Kendo&rsquo;s Gym. The owner of this place was an old japanese lady. While on the normal menu was made of the usual food like sandwiches or mexican food, there was a special menu served on request. Such special menu was made of Japanese dishes. Home made Japanese food made of squid, soy sauce, rice, seaweed and Japanese bread. There was also small Japanese cakes. The taste of japanese food is quite different from Mexican food. Sweet food like cakes are made with much less sugar in contrast with Mexican common cakes that are really sweet. In general, Mexican food is more spiced and have a stronger flavor than Japanese food. Most people I have met outside the Otaku community find original Japanese food either tasteless or disgusting. However, it was pretty common to find college students, Kendo practitioners and people from all over the city, mostly teenagers, eating from the Japanese menu with their own high quality chopsticks.</p>

<p>This group that enjoys the Japanese culture is facing discrimination from different groups. People from previous generations have trouble understanding ideas that are being adopted by the Otaku community. Japanese culture looks at first glance alien to them. Even news outlets have hard time reporting on things from Japan. A few week ago I heard in the radio the news about how the Japanese princess Mako is about to marry her commoner boyfriend Kel Komuro. However, the note from the radio was about how she was losing her right to the throne. The problem with this note was that Princess Mako had not rights to the throne no woman can claim it unless a new law is approved. Many remain indifferent to cultural differences and in particular towards Asian cultures. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons kids that enjoy cultural expressions from japan are made outcasts by teachers and parents and even by some of their peers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had several students that are Otaku. Most of them either hide it or go full <em>in your face</em> mode, talking all the time about their activities related to anime and how great they think that a live modeled by the anime standards could be. This eventually can become annoying for their peers, which in turn step aside and stop interacting with them. The best way I have found to help them is to bring to the surface the good values that they already are exposed to. Being an anime fan from long time, I&rsquo;m familiar with the ideas behind anime stories. Perseverance, hard work, a strong sense of community are values that can be found in that media. Of course, there are also bad stereotypes and some values are hard to grasp from the perspective of the western culture. That&rsquo;s where acceptance comes into play. Making them feel accepted allows them to identify ideas that, when interpreted the wrong way, can be harmful to them. Without having to worry about to be criticized, I have noticed how they engage more in classroom activities and an improvement in their overall mood. They usually set higher goals than their peers and invest more free time in school projects. I also have notice an improvement in the interaction with their classmates as they become more open and less defensive when exposing their own ideas.</p>

<p>This cultural void created by the struggles of three generations have created the situation where teenagers have been adopted ideas from other cultures. I strongly believe that this will be helpful for creating a better and stronger society. However, we have to try to guide them through this crisis of values without trying to make them to abandon activities that are harmless and enjoyable to them. This guide is of big importance as there are cases where misconceptions can lead into adopting harmful stereotypes.</p>
